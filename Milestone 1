Development Method: Agile/Scrum

Communication Plan: Our team currently has a groupme chat set up for organizing meetings, and keeping up with milestones. We plan to meet weekly on Friday from 1 to 3. Otherwise, we will use Github to ask questions and clarify details with our teammates. 

Proposed Architecture Plan: In the backend of the app we will have image recognition technology written in python with OpenCV. We also expect to have information about different currencies supporting our various features in the backend. If we include a login feature we will have a database in SQL. In the frontend we are going to use Swift for (IOS) and try to make the same app in Android Studio. To connect the two we will use Nodejs. 

Meeting Plan: We are meeting face to face on Fridays from 1 to 3 in the C4C.
